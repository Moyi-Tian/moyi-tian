<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<p><b>Snaking Bifurcation on Ring Lattices</b>
</p>
<p><i>Summer 2020 - Now</i>
</p>
<p>Starting from Summer 2020, I did a research project instructed by Professor Björn Sandstede studying the stationary patterns and bifurcation diagrams in bistable lattice dynamical systems with small coupling strength. We initially explored numerically on random graphs, and then narrowed down to ring lattices with symmetric coupling where we observed snaking bifurcation diagrams regardless of the number of neighbors being connected. Specifically, we proved that the sparse coupling case (nearest-neighbor/next-nearest-neighbor coupling) has bifurcation diagram with many saddle-nodes, while the all-to-all coupling case leads to six saddle-nodes always.

<h2>Past Projects</h2>
<p><b>Class Project: Mesh Texture: Learning Continuous Texture Representation for Conditional and Unconditional Texture Synthesis of 3D Meshes</b>
</p>
<p><i>CSCI 2470: Deep Learning, Brown University, Fall 2020</i>
</p>
<p>I did a project in a group of four focusing on designing an architecture that can learn detailed textures across a latent space of images and shapes, thus capable of probabilistically generating realistic, novel textures for previously unseen meshes. Inspired by recent work, TextureFields and SIREN, we explored varying methods of shape-representations, alternative loss metrics, and high-frequency learning techniques. We demonstrated that applying Fourier feature transformations through a positional encoding is an effective means for learning more detailed textures.

<h3>Undergraduate Research Projects</h3>
<p><b>Honors Project in Mathematics: Topological and Algebraic Properties of Braids and Annular Braids</b>
</p>
<p><i>Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, September 2018-May 2019</i>
</p>
<p>I did an honors project advised by Professor David Richeson on using various algebraic descriptions of the annular braid group to analyze maypole dancing during my senior year at Dickinson College. I studied the background knowledge in knots and links, the Artin braid group and the annular braids and explored how we can examine and understand maypole dances using the theories. In my thesis, I gave three presentations to describe the annular braid group and used the annular braid group as a medium to abstract the braids in maypole dances and therefore apply an algebraic analysis. Also, I discussed some essential properties embedded in the maypole braids, which are related to the invariants of annular braids - the crossing number and the step number.

<p><b>Physics Senior Research: Experimental Realization of Symmetry Breaking in Coupled Logistic Maps</b>
</p>
<p><i>Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, September 2018-May 2019</i>
</p>
<p>During my senior year at Dickinson College, I did a physics project on the coupled logistic maps with my lab partner Houssem Mhiri advised by Professor Lars English. Using the mathematical model of the logistic maps as the theoretical foundation, we modified L’Her’s electronic design, a physical representation of coupled discrete-time logistic maps published in 2016, by implementing it using an Arduino and adding power supplies to control the initial conditions. We further reduced the number of outlets and produced the desired input signals and voltages using a single multifunction DAQ device with LabView. Then, we examined that symmetry-broken solutions manifest in this circuit for appropriately chosen initial conditions, and investigated experimentally the basins of attraction of these solutions, as well as their dependence on the coupling strength. Moreover, we delved into the chaotic regime and constructed experimental bifurcation diagrams. One intriguing phenomenon captured here involves the transition from synchronized chaos to decoherent chaos as the coupling is increased. Finally, we experimentally implemented uni-directional coupling and explored the dynamics of a driven logistic map.
